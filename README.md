# Vehicle crash detection system using Raspberry Pi 
Smart Detection.py- The Raspberry Pi is programmed to sense any obstacle in its path and stop the motor once sensed < 10 cm. The obstacle distance sensed constantly and time data is uploaded in GCP Firebase using APIs.  

GUI.py- In this code, we extract the distance and time data stored, to depict how the Raspberry Pi had moved. This is an animated GUI depiction.
